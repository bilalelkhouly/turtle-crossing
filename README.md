# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple yet entertaining Python game called "Turtle Crossing" that you can play using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a turtle that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars and avoid obstacles to reach the other side safely. The game is easy to understand and provides a fun challenge.

## How to Play

- Use the "Up" arrow key to make your turtle move forward.
- Use the "Right" arrow key to move the turtle to the right.
- Use the "Left" arrow key to move the turtle to the left.

The objective of the game is to safely navigate your turtle to the top of the screen without colliding with any cars or obstacles. The game becomes progressively more challenging as you advance, with more cars and obstacles appearing on the road.

## How to Run

To play the game, simply execute the `main.py` script. The game window will open, and you can control the turtle using the arrow keys.

```bash python main.py
```

## Game Components

- **Player (Turtle):** This is the character you control with the arrow keys. The goal is to get the turtle to the top of the screen.

- **Obstacles:** Obstacles are stationary objects that you must also avoid while crossing the road.
